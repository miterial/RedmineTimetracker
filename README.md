# RedmineTimetracker
A desktop application that allows to track issue time on Redmine

User must provide DB credentials and credentials to Redmine server in order to run this application.
User is able to choose assigned tasks and start tracking time for it.

FXML, MongoDB, Lombok annotations and Redmine API were used in this project.

P.S. This is rather an old application which I made starting my job as a Java developer, so it lacks security checks
